This repository contains a collection of hands‑on Linux learning projects, notes, and exercises that document my progression toward command‑line mastery and security‑focused system administration. Each topic reflects practical experience gained through real usage, experimentation, and troubleshooting across multiple Linux environments.

My focus is on building a strong, foundational understanding of Linux by working directly in the terminal, breaking things, fixing them, and learning how systems behave under real conditions. These notes serve as both a personal knowledge base and a reference for other engineers exploring Linux fundamentals.

## What This Repository Showcases
- Real‑world Linux command‑line workflows  
- File system navigation and system structure  
- User, group, and permission management  
- Networking fundamentals and troubleshooting  
- Process and service management

## Tools and Technologies

This repository uses a variety of Linux distributions, tools, and utilities that support real‑world system administration, security learning, and command‑line practice. The goal is to build confidence and fluency across multiple environments.

### Linux Distributions
- **Kali Linux:** security‑focused workflows and tooling  
- **Ubuntu Server:** administration, services, and server‑side practice  
- **WSL2:** daily command‑line practice on Windows  

### Core Command‑Line Tools
- **File & Directory Tools:** ls, cd, cp, mv, rm, find, grep  
- **Networking Tools:** ping, ip, ss, curl, nmap  
- **Process Tools:** ps, top, htop, kill, systemctl  
- **Text Manipulation:** cat, less, head, tail, awk, sed  
- **Shell Scripting:** Bash, environment variables, loops, conditionals  

### Security & Utility Tools
- **ssh:** remote access and management  
- **netcat:** networking exercises and basic enumeration  
- **nmap:** scanning and discovery  
- **chmod, chown, sudo:** permissions and privilege management  

These tools form the foundation of the exercises in this repository, enabling hands‑on learning, troubleshooting, and experimentation across multiple Linux environments.

## Project Highlights
- Command‑line fundamentals and file system exploration
